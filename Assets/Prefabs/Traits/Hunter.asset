  _description: Poaching is a serious crime, but it didn't bother you, and hunting
    fed you and your entire family until the Lords decided to send special squads
    to search for your kind. One of them caught you, and you barely managed to get
    out of the hanging. Now you are looking for another way to make money.
  _briefDescription: Bows do 50% more damage
