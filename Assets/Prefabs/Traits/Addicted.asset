  _description: Gurzune dust, horn-weed, aether, dwarven mushroom - you've tried
    it all, and more than once. Now you have great tolerance to toxic substances.
    However, there is a downside - alchemical potions no longer have an effect on
    you. Except for a little relaxation.
  _briefDescription: 'Potions and poison effect do not affect you
